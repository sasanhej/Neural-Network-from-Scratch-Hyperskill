<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>All we need to do is to see how well the model performs while training. You can see now why we've recommended the <code class="language-python">estimator</code> and <code class="language-python">alpha</code> parameters in the epoch training function in stage 4. If you have followed our advice, you need to use the same training loop you have created previously, only replacing the <code class="language-python">estimator</code> with our new <code class="language-python">TwoLayerNeural</code> class model.</p>
<p>In this stage, we want you to train the model with 20 epochs, batch size of <code class="language-python">100</code> and alpha of <code class="language-python">0.5</code>, like in stage 4. Don't forget to log the accuracies after each epoch as it's been done previously. You need to print them to pass the tests.</p>
<p>Use <code class="language-python">X_train</code>, <code class="language-python">y_train</code> to train your model, and <code class="language-python">X_test</code>, <code class="language-python">y_test</code> to calculate the accuracies.</p>
<p>You can use the provided <code class="language-python">plot</code> function to visualize how the loss and accuracy change while the model is training or you can code it on your own.</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<p>Put everything together and train your model with 20 epochs, batch size of <code class="language-python">100</code>, and alpha of <code class="language-python">0.5</code>. Use the functions of stage 4. Print the final list of accuracies after each epoch.</p>
