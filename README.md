# Neural-Network-from-Scratch-Hyperskill
This is "Neural Network from Scratch Hyperskill" project form Hyperskill.<br>
While completing this project, you will get your first experience in every aspect of creating a fully connected neural network. You will code feedforward networks and implement backpropagation and weight initialization. You will also create a training loop and visualize your model's training process. These skills will give you a solid base to continue with neural network science.<br>
Let's train a very simple but fully connected neural network! In this project, we'll create the necessary metric functions and use custom feedforward and backpropagation methods and functions, all done by hand. The dataset for this project is Fashion-MNIST â€“ no more boring number recognition.<br>
Note: This repository contains all files from Hyperskill for evaluating each step of the project and quizes and etc.<br>
